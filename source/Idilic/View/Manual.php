Local Commands:
Local commands begin with a "/", like /login or /pub

It is recommended to use "/login" and "/register" to
perform the respective actions rather than  the bare
"login" and "register" as the UI will prompt for a
password separately rather than printing it to the
terminal.

Run "/commands" for the full list of local commands.

Server Commands
server commands are barwords like "pub", "sub" or
"unsub".

Run "commands" for the full list of server commands.

Binary Messages:
Binary messages are transmitted on channels named by
a single 16 bit value in the range of 0x0000-0xFFFF.

Binary messages will come in this format:

>> 0x00320000 02 9A DE AD AF
 or
>> 0x0000 02 9A DE AD AF

The first example signifies that it is a message that
originated from user 0x0032 and was published to channel
0x0000. This is displayed as one long header: 0x00320000.

The second example signifies that the message originated
on the server.

Run the following commands to test:
<< sub 0x0000
<< /pub 0000 01 AF A0 FA DF

Please note these numbers are hexadecimal.

Text Messages:
Text messages will come in the following format:
{
    "message": "message",
    "origin": "user",
    "originId": 50,
    "channel": "random:channel:name",
    "originalChannel": "random:*"
}

"originId" represents the user who sent the message, in
decimal.

"channel" is the channel the message was RECEIVED on.

message was PUBLISHED on.

Run the following commands to test:
